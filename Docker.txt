What is Docker ?

Docker is the world’s leading software container platform

Docker makes the process of application deployment very easy and efficient and resolves a lot of issues related to deploying applications.Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to deploy and run applications by using containers

Docker gives you a standard way of packaging your application with all its dependencies in a container.Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. 

Yum install docker

docker --version

sudo service docker start

sudo usermod -a -G docker "user"  -Relogin to make the changes effective

docker --help   *- eg: docker run --help

docker login    *- to login to dockerhub

docker images   *- shows the images

docker images -q *- shows only the image id

docker images --help

docker pull   *-First searches locally and if not found pulls from dockerhub

docker rmi <imageid>  *-to remove the image

docker images -f "dangling=true" *-search google

docker inspect imgid  *- gives the complete info of image. Image is a stack of layers.

docker ps  *-shows the running containers

docker ps -a *- shows all the containers

docker run ubuntu *-pulls the image from dockerhub if it is not present locally

docker run -it ubuntu ( -it is for the input and output)

docker run --name MyUbuntu -it ubuntu *-gives the name to the container

docker run --help

docker start contid  (docker start -a contid  :  -a shows the o/p)

docker stop contid  (stop vs kill)

docker logs contid  (displays the logs of the container for both running and stopped)

docker pause contID  *-to pause

docker unpause contId *-to unpause

docker top contId  *-shows the process

docker stats contId *- stats of running container

docker attach contId  *-to attach to the container

docker kill contid  *-kills only running container

docker rm contid  *-to remove the container

docker stats  *-all the memory stats are available

docker system df *-to check the disk usage

docker system prune --help *-to remove unused data

docker container create  *- creates the container in stopped state

docker system prune 

 	-WARNING! This will remove:
        - all stopped containers
        - all networks not used by at least one container
        - all dangling images
        - all build cache

-------------------------------------------------------------------DOCKERFILE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker file: https://takacsmark.com/dockerfile-tutorial-by-example-dockerfile-best-practices-2018/

A text file with instructions to build image

create a file named Dockerfile

create a folder and file Dockerfile.

edit the Dockerfile

FROM : for base image ..scratch-> empty image

RUN -> executes during the build of image

CMD --> executes only when the container is created out of image

docker build <location of the file>

docker build -t myimage:1.0 . (if present in the file location)  (-t is the tag -t imagename:tag)

 Docker pulls the base image and create a container then the snapshot of the filesystem is taken and the container is deleted. (Intermediate containers)
  
 the created image is built into container and the RUN cmds are executed in the container built from the last image. the container is then deleted and a new image is created

CMD command takes the image from the last step and build a new container and removes the container after the command is executed and builds the final image.

If the dockerfile is built again. Docker uses the cache. But if the operations steps are changed in Dockerfile then the whole process goes again.


CONTAINER PORT MAPPING:

docker run -p 5000:8080 image id
   
5000: Routes incoming requests to the port on local hosts to 8080:the port inside the container
